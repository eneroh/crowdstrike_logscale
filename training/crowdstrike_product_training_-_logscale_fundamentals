=== crowdstrike_product_training_-_logscale_fundamentals ===

--- overview ---
> Index free log management solution
> Logscale was previously referred to as: humio
> The Humio brand was purchased and re-branded as LogScale under Crowdstrike's flag
> Data is pulled in at real-time/near real-time
> The data is pulled into different OU's (organisational units reference to AD, unsure if actually associated to AD) or repositories (reference to GitHub, probably like data tables in KQL)
> SOAR capabilities, i.e. automations/responses to certain alerts/incidents
> Query log management
> Not solely for security purposes, can also be used for infrastructure/i.t. management. Likely a very hoslitic approach to how it is used within business
> Ingest over 1 petabyte per day (stored in the cloud?)

> Network
> Security
> IOT
> Public or private cloud

--- data forefront ---
> Data normalisation - Ensuring data is readily available and is clearly labelling and consistent throughout (data tables are clear, formatting is consistant and the ability to pull information is not hindered)
> Data lake - Putting data into a centralised location, a central "Data lake"
> Data correlation - one data source can point to another useful data source and that data can correlate to each other to provide a more clear picture of what is occurring in an alert/incident

--- other tool integrations ---
> SOAR/workflow automations: Phantom, Tines
Alert triggers in logscale as critieria are met
> Incident platform: Jira, ServiceNow

--- IMPORTANT ---
EVERYTHING IS TIMESTAMPED, time plays a key role like with all log systems

--- visualisations ---
You dont need to use crowdstrike dashboards, you can use grafana
