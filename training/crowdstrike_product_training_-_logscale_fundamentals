=== crowdstrike_product_training_-_logscale_fundamentals ===

--- overview ---
> Index free log management solution
> Logscale was previously referred to as: humio
> The Humio brand was purchased and re-branded as LogScale under Crowdstrike's flag
> Data is pulled in at real-time/near real-time
> The data is pulled into different OU's (organisational units reference to AD, unsure if actually associated to AD) or repositories (reference to GitHub, probably like data tables in KQL)
> SOAR capabilities, i.e. automations/responses to certain alerts/incidents
> Query log management
> Not solely for security purposes, can also be used for infrastructure/i.t. management. Likely a very hoslitic approach to how it is used within business
> Ingest over 1 petabyte per day (stored in the cloud?)

--- pull logs from ---
> Falcon EDR, machines with agent?
> Email/SWG
> CASB
> IAM
> DLP
> Firewall/NTA/IPS
> Containers
> Desktops
> RFID
> Packaged apps
> Storage
> Servers
> Custom apps
> Smartphones
> Databases
> GPS locations
> Online services
> Networks
> Call detail records
> Online shopping carts
> Web services
> Messaging

Simplified:
> Network
> Splunk
> Servers
> Endpoints
> Apps
> Crible edge
> Observability data lakes

--- ingest and digest ---
> Process
> Parsing
> Validate input
> Timestamp
> In memory
> Segment files
> Live queries
> Insights

--- use cases ---
> Business
> Application
> Infrastructure
> Network
> Security
> IOT
> Public or private cloud

--- data forefront ---
> Data normalisation - Ensuring data is readily available and is clearly labelling and consistent throughout (data tables are clear, formatting is consistant and the ability to pull information is not hindered)
> Data lake - Putting data into a centralised location, a central "Data lake"
> Data correlation - one data source can point to another useful data source and that data can correlate to each other to provide a more clear picture of what is occurring in an alert/incident

--- data availability ---
> Nothing is written to disk, so no wait times
> Sit in memory for 24-36 hours, depending on build
> Fastest to least fastest
> Compressed data, stores for longer for cheaper
> Live data, no need for archiving

--- bucket storage ---
> Cloud deployments
> Less expensive
> Fast
> Easier to run
> Archiving
> Other businesses use bucket storage as archiving
> Bucket storage is PRIMARY STORAGE BY CROWDSTRIKE
> Localdisk is cache

LOGS > STORAGE > CACHE > TIMEFRAME > TAGS > BLOOM FILTER > COMPRESSION > CACHE > STORAGE

--- other tool integrations ---
> SOAR/workflow automations: Phantom, Tines
Alert triggers in logscale as critieria are met
> Incident platform: Jira, ServiceNow

--- IMPORTANT ---
EVERYTHING IS TIMESTAMPED, time plays a key role like with all log systems

--- visualisations ---
You dont need to use crowdstrike dashboards, you can use grafana

--- cribl ---
> Data visualization/auditing solution
> Simplifies data
> Cribl search function
> Pull in log, endpoint, iot info etc.
> Store for compliance but doesnt need to be searchable
> Configurable in GUI and cancel communication to logscale
> Take only specific pieces of data to S3 bucket and the rest into LogScale

--- data onboarding ---
> Collect data
> Process data
